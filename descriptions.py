Next to you, you see a skeleton holding a burning hammer that is too hot to touch.
There is a table here, or what remains of it. As it burns away you can almost make out
a glint from within the flames engulfing it.""",

down. Before you are coffins, some open. Within them, skeletons. Surrounding them, also skeletons.
The skeletons themselves are surrounded by skeletons. You feel incredibly uncomfortable."""

outside, making it impossible to see aside from brief flashes of lightning. The flashes seem to light up numerous
glowing sets of eyes that seem to stare directly at you before disappearing, along with the light. Some are outside.
Some, regrettably, are inside. Are you perhaps imagining things? Hopefully so..."""

thick forest vegetation is slowly constricting around you."""

at your feet. Looking up from the skull, you see a massive pyramid made exclusively out of bones, some human, some
nonhuman and some others wholly unnatural. Is it just your imagination, or are all of the skulls in the pyramid
slowly turning to look at you?"""

a few crudely made tools and vials. They seem abandoned."""
